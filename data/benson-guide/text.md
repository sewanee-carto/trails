# Benson’s Trail Guide

There are few people who know the Domain’s more than 50 miles of trails as well as Sewanee Outing Program Director John Benson, so we asked him to put together this guide to 10 of his favorite hikes, ranging in length from one mile to 20 miles.


## The Cross / Tennessee Williams Trail

miles: 1.25

route: loop

directions: Start at the Cross. Facing the valley, head left, follow- ing the Perimeter Trail, being careful to follow the blue blazes. You’ll cross over the old road to the Cross and then turn left on a fire lane. This will take you back to the Tennessee Williams Trail, which parallels the portion of Tennessee Ave. from the soccer field to the Cross. Take another left on this trail and follow it back to the Cross.

description: This largely overlooked and shady section of trail offers an easy and relaxing hike through rolling topography. Remarkable features include a spot where the trail narrows through a split in a huge sandstone block and an easy stream crossing thanks to two perfectly placed flat rocks.  On the first section of this hike, the trail will take you directly over a boulder that displays a geometric design of Liesegang banding. The pattern looks manmade; it’s not. Liesegang banding is formed by iron deposits from water seep- ing through sandstone and is responsible for many elaborate designs found in the sandstone cliffs around Sewanee.


## Morgan’s Steep to the Cross

miles: 1

route: one way

directions: Start at Morgan’s Steep. Facing the valley, head down the stairs you’ll find to the left and follow the blue blazes to the Memorial Cross and University View.  

description: It’s the most frequently hiked section of the Perimeter Trail, and for good reason: This one-mile stretch has it all — gorgeous overlooks, waterfalls, sandstone overhangs and even a stone tunnel. Most of the trail runs just below the bluff, but it starts and ends at two of the best views on the Domain — Morgan’s Steep and Uni- versity View — with a bonus overlook if you scramble up to the top of Proctor’s Hall. The tunnel through Proctor’s Hall is reason enough to make the hike, inscribed with names carved over 100 years ago. This trail, as well as the one through Shakerag Hollow, was constructed by the Civilian Conserva- tion Corps in the 1930s. Take a moment to admire the CCC’s impressive stone steps up the hill from the stream crossing.  Walking this section at dusk provides a continuous view of the sunset.


## Bridal Veil Falls

miles: 2

route: round-trip

directions: Facing the valley at Morgan’s Steep, take the Perimeter Trail to your right. After two-tenths of a mile, cross a wooden bridge and turn left, following the Bridal Veil Falls Trail (white blazes) down the slope. The trail will intersect another trail; turn left to get to the waterfall. There’s 400 feet of elevation change on this trail.

description: The trail is an alternating series of steep slopes and flat benches leading off the plateau to a waterfall. The falls are spectacular, especially after a good rain. Other remarkable features along the way include large sandstone blocks and boulders that long ago broke away from the bluffs above and grapevines hanging from the trees. Look for this same setting on other trails that drop off the plateau such as Thumping Dick Cove, Shakerag Hollow, and the Old Cowan Road.  Bridal Veil Falls appears from the side of the mountain, cascades 27 feet down a limestone cliff, drops about 25 feet more, and then disappears into a sinkhole. Karst topography, man!


## Elliott Point/Parallel Trail

miles: 3.5

route: loop

directions: Head toward the Equestrian Center on Breakfield Road and turn left on Girault Jones Drive. From the cul-de-sac at the end of this road, continue on foot in the same direction on a fire lane. After 100 yards, you’ll reach the single-track Perimeter Trail (blue blazes). Turn right onto the Perimeter Trail, and follow the blue blazes
until the trail intersects the Parallel Trail. (If you want a quick detour, Lake Audubon is just down the hill to the left.) Turn right onto the Parallel Trail and follow it back to the starting point. 

description: Most of this trail is a beautiful bluff path with a final stretch along a wide fire lane through the woods. After the first creek crossing, the trail passes through an old sandstone quarry site where you can see
evidence of drilling in the rocks. Take a look back over your shoulder at the creek bed to see a lot of the discarded quarry stone. Elliott Point seems to be the obvious overlook on this route, but the best view is farther along the trail. About halfway between Elliott Point and Lake Audubon, where the trail briefly splits in two for 200 feet, stay on the bluff side to find the rock outcrop. Perfect for a picnic for two.


## Western Section of the Perimeter Trail

miles: 7.5

route: loop

directions: Start at Gate 5. Walk straight out the fire lane to the Perimeter Trail. Turn left onto the Perimeter Trail and follow the blue blazes all the way to Lake Audubon. Continue past the lake and turn left at the intersection of fire lanes. This fire lane will lead you to Gate 14. Turn right onto Breakfield Road, and a short walk takes you
back to Gate 5. 

description: This long hike covers the westernmost portion of the Perimeter Trail and provides a bit of everything. There are many views, named and unnamed. There is a popular rock climbing area (Armfield Bluff) which is a good halfway picnic spot. After that, the terrain changes as the trail drops below the bluff, following an old roadbed thick with summer foliage and big sandstone blocks. Coming back up onto the plateau, you reach King’s Farm. A quiet and pretty clearing with two huge sugar maple trees marks the old homestead. Then comes one my favorite stretches of trail, leading to Audubon Lake. This entire hike is the payoff.


## Forestry Cabin/Dotson Point loop

miles: 4.5

route: loop

directions:  Start at Gate 5. From here, it’s a straight shot out the fire lane to the Perimeter Trail. (At this
point, a detour to the right on the Perimeter Trail will take you to the Forestry Cabin.) Turn left onto the Perimeter Trail and follow it all the way to Gate 8 at the end of Breakfield Road. Follow the road back to Gate 5. 

description: This route along the bluff and through mountain laurels is great for hiking as well as mountain biking (with a few dismounts). A short detour gets you to the Forestry Cabin for a good view of the valley. Dotson Point further along the trail also offers a nice view, but note that the farthest rock out on Dotson Point is not for acrophobes. Views from the Forestry Cabin and from Dotson Point are from opposite sides of Thumping Dick Cove,
so you can see where you were or where you are going.


## Thumping Dick Cove

miles: 2

route: round-trip

directions:  Start at Gate 7 on Breakfield Road. After eight-tenths of a mile, the old road crosses a broken wooden bridge. A small path (which is not easily visible) is located on the left just on the far side of the washedout
bridge. Follow the little path down the steep slope to the small cave on the left.  

description:  The trail starts on an old road that drops down into the cove and leads to a small, kid-friendly cave on the left that can be fun to explore with a flashlight. The more popular but more technical Solomon’s Temple Cave is on the right 50 yards farther down around the bend. Thumping Dick Cove has all the elements of a classic old-growth forest: a wide range of large, mature trees and smaller ones create a multilayered canopy. 


## Cedar Hollow Lake

miles: 2

route: loop

directions:  Start at Gate 4 on Breakfield Road. (Be careful not to block the gate with your car.) Head north on the fire lane and take the first right onto another fire lane. Continue straight and take a left at the next junction. Then take a right at the next intersection, heading to Cedar Hollow Lake. Once you get past the lake, turn right at the first junction. Head straight. Just past the orange gate, look for the three short concrete posts on your right and turn right here, back into the woods. Take this all the way back to Gate 4.  

description:  From start to finish, you’ll be on fire lanes for this entire hike. The lanes are wider than normal hiking trails, so you can easily walk side-by-side with a friend. The last section of this hike leads you through a tall pine forest straight out of a Disney movie. The trees prevent sunlight from hitting the forest floor, completely shading out plant growth. This magical area is referred to by many as “Fairyland.” The perfect outdoor setting
to enjoy a stroll and catch up with an old friend. And if your old friend is a dog, the lake provides a cool swim.


## Shakerag Hollow/Beckwith’s Point loop

miles: 3.5

route: loop

directions:  Start at Green’s View. Facing the valley, take the trail on your right. When you come to the first signpost, follow the Beckwith’s Point Trail, which stays on top of the plateau. Coming out of the woods, follow the signs indicating the trail continues along the edge of the golf course. After the short section on the golf course, the trail re-enters the woods, taking you all the way to the Perimeter Trail. Take a left onto the Perimeter Trail, which leads you down into Shakerag Hollow. (Taking a right leads you to the University’s east gates.) Follow the
trail and take a left at the signpost pointing to Green’s View.   

description:  The highlight of the first section of this hike is Beckwith’s Point. This long-forgotten overlook into Shakerag Hollow was once featured on postcards sold at the University Supply Store. Today, you’ll likely have it all to yourself. Constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s, the Shakerag Hollow Trail is one of the oldest trails on the Domain. It descends through a virtually undisturbed cove of hardwood forest, an area frequented by botany students. Hike here often during March and April to see the display of blooms change from week to week.


## Piney Point 

miles: 3.5

route: round-trip

directions:   Piney Point is one of the few places on the Domain where the native shortleaf pine is a dominant member of the forest community. The dense forest and thick tunnels of mountain laurel provide a sharp contrast to the overlook. A bonus is the relatively flat terrain with two bridged stream crossings.   

description:   Piney Point is one of the few places on the Domain where the native shortleaf pine is a dominant member of the forest community. The dense forest and thick tunnels of mountain laurel provide a sharp contrast to the overlook. A bonus is the relatively flat terrain with two bridgedstream crossings. Piney Point is a striking promontory that boasts a sweeping view over Shakerag Hollow and Roark’s Cove. If you time it right in the summer, you can eat wild blueberries right off the bush all the way to the point.
